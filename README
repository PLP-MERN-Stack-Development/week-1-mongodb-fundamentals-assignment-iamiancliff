## 🔎 Sample Queries (from `queries.js`)

- Find all books in a specific genre
- Find books published after a certain year
- Find books by a specific author
- Update the price of a specific book
- Delete a book by its title
- Find books in stock and published after 2010
- Sort by price (ascending/descending)
- Limit and skip (pagination)
- Aggregation: average price per genre, most published author, count per decade
- Indexing:
  - Create index on `title`
  - Create compound index on `author` and `published_year`
  - Use `.explain("executionStats")` to analyze performance
